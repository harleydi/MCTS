# Project Overview

**Project decription:** This is a website based of a place where children and teens can come to get help without having to be thrown into ACS or as we know "The System" because of a lack of guardianship ect., and get opportunities and have better outcomes as every child deserves to have.

## Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous section, try to breakdown the logic further into stateless/stateful components. 

| Component | Description |Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Header | The Header receives props that render multiple nav titles and links | Functional |
| NavBar | The links to the pages that will be rendered in the main | Functional |
| Main | This component houses multiple rendered views through React Router and controls data received from the initial API call in state | Class |
| Footer | Copyrights and contacts | Functional |
